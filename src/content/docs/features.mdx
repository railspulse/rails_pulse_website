## Organization & Filtering

Rails Pulse includes a flexible tagging system for organizing and filtering your performance data:

- Tag routes, requests, queries, jobs, and job runs with custom labels
- Filter performance data by custom tags
- Organize monitoring data by environment, priority, or custom categories
- Tags appear as badges in all data tables for quick visual identification

Learn more about the tagging system in the [Advanced Configuration](/documentation/advanced#tagging) documentation.
