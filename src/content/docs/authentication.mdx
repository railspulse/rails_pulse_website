title: Authentication
description: Secure your Rails Pulse dashboard with flexible authentication options
---

Rails Pulse supports flexible authentication to secure access to your monitoring dashboard. Works with any authentication system including Devise, custom solutions, and more.

## Authentication Setup

Enable authentication by configuring the following options in your Rails Pulse initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/rails_pulse.rb
RailsPulse.configure do |config|
  # Enable authentication
  config.authentication_enabled = true

  # Where to redirect unauthorized users (optional, defaults to "/")
  config.authentication_redirect_path = "/login"

  # Define your authentication logic
  config.authentication_method = proc {
    # Your authentication logic here
  }
end
```

## Devise with Admin Role

The most common authentication pattern uses Devise with an admin role check:

```ruby
# config/initializers/rails_pulse.rb
RailsPulse.configure do |config|
  config.authentication_enabled = true

  config.authentication_method = proc {
    unless user_signed_in? && current_user.admin?
      redirect_to main_app.root_path, alert: "Access denied"
    end
  }
end
```

This ensures only signed-in admin users can access the Rails Pulse dashboard.

## Custom Authorization Logic

You can implement any custom authorization logic based on your application's needs:

```ruby
# config/initializers/rails_pulse.rb
RailsPulse.configure do |config|
  config.authentication_enabled = true

  config.authentication_method = proc {
    current_user = User.find_by(id: session[:user_id])
    unless current_user&.can_access_monitoring?
      render plain: "Forbidden", status: :forbidden
    end
  }
end
```

## IP Address Restriction

Restrict access to specific IP addresses or ranges:

```ruby
# config/initializers/rails_pulse.rb
RailsPulse.configure do |config|
  config.authentication_enabled = true

  config.authentication_method = proc {
    allowed_ips = ["127.0.0.1", "::1", "10.0.0.0/8"]
    unless allowed_ips.any? { |ip| IPAddr.new(ip).include?(request.remote_ip) }
      render plain: "Access denied", status: :forbidden
    end
  }
end
```

## HTTP Basic Authentication

For simple authentication, use HTTP Basic Auth:

```ruby
# config/initializers/rails_pulse.rb
RailsPulse.configure do |config|
  config.authentication_enabled = true

  config.authentication_method = proc {
    authenticate_or_request_with_http_basic do |username, password|
      username == ENV["RAILS_PULSE_USERNAME"] &&
        password == ENV["RAILS_PULSE_PASSWORD"]
    end
  }
end
```

:::caution[Security Warning]
Store credentials in environment variables, never commit them to your repository. Use Rails credentials or a secrets management service in production.
:::

## Environment-Based Access

Disable authentication in development, enable it in production:

```ruby
# config/initializers/rails_pulse.rb
RailsPulse.configure do |config|
  # Only require authentication in production
  config.authentication_enabled = Rails.env.production?

  config.authentication_method = proc {
    unless user_signed_in? && current_user.admin?
      redirect_to main_app.root_path, alert: "Access denied"
    end
  }
end
```

## Best Practices

- **Always enable authentication in production** - Performance data can reveal sensitive information about your application
- **Use role-based access control** - Limit dashboard access to administrators or DevOps team members
- **Combine authentication methods** - Use both user authentication and IP restrictions for extra security
- **Log access attempts** - Monitor who accesses the dashboard and when
- **Use environment variables** - Never hardcode credentials in your initializer

## Next Steps

- Learn about single vs separate [database configuration](/documentation/database)
- Customize performance thresholds, tagging, and data retention in [advanced settings](/documentation/advanced)
